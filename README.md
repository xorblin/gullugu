# GulluGu.com

Gullugu is an open-source chat platform built on Node.js, Socket.io, Express.js, Redis, MongoDB, and other technologies. The project aims to provide a replacement for the now-defunct Omegle, fostering a sense of community and trust through open-source development.
## Features

- **Real-time Chatting:** Gullugu enables users to engage in real-time text-based conversations with strangers.

- **Anonymous Connections:** Users can connect with each other anonymously, similar to the concept of Omegle.

- **Open Source:** The entire codebase of Gullugu is open source, allowing for community contributions, transparency, and building trust among users.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** Server-side JavaScript runtime.
  
- **Express.js:** Web application framework for Node.js, simplifying the development of web applications.

- **Socket.io:** Real-time bidirectional event-based communication for enabling chat functionality.

- **Redis:** In-memory data structure store used for caching, which enhances performance.

- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database used for storing user data and chat logs.

- **Others:** (Add any other technologies you've used in your project)
